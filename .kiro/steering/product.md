# Happy Feet - Shoe Marketplace

Happy Feet is a console-based Java application that implements a fully functioning shoe marketplace. The system supports two types of users:

- **Customers**: Can browse products, search by various criteria, manage shopping carts, and make purchases
- **Sellers**: Can manage stores, add/remove/edit products, and view sales data

The application uses file-based persistence to store user accounts, seller data, and customer information. The marketplace allows customers to search for shoes by name, price, store, description, or quantity, while sellers can manage multiple stores and track their revenue.
